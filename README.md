Sampark is not just another communication platform. What sets it apart from others is it will provide a streamlined and centralised platform for managing and sending bulk messages, decreasing the time and effort necessary for large-scale communications dramatically, increasing the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns and increasing conversion rates.

Tech stack: DJANGO, HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, TWILLIO

Process: Firstly, we discussed the workflow of the website, its design and topography. On the first day, I started working on the backend in which I tried to implement all our services for single user and my other mates started working on the front-end. Through Django, we made an authentication system, WhatsApp messenger, set up settings for email and sms services. Slowly on the next day, implemented services for multiple user in email and sms. In sms, I added an option to insert phone numbers using csv file which makes it more easier.

Features includes:
1. Easy user interface
2. login/register
2. Automatic WhatsApp message sender
3. Multiple user
